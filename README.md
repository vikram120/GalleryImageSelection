# GalleryImageSelection

#This project is a simple iOS app that demonstrates how to select an image from the device's photo library and display it in a UIImageView within a UIView. It uses the UIImagePickerController to enable the user to choose an image from the gallery. The selected image is then set as the content of the UIImageView, providing immediate visual feedback to the user. This project serves as a starting point for integrating image selection functionality into your own iOS apps.
